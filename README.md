# LandRegisteration
Land registry in many parts of the world is very slow and
cumbersome process. There are also many intermediaries involved in the process of land
registration. It is  a system that not only accelerate the process of land registration, but also
make it easier for Buyers, Sellers and Government registrars to transfer the land ownership from
seller to a new buyer,  a distributed system that store all the transactions
made during the process of land buying. In this Project we have tried to explore the possibilities and
problems solved by using a blockchain based system for land ownership transfer. The system that
we are trying to implement is based on Ethereum Blockchain that will store all the transactions
made during the process of land ownership transfer.This system will solve the problems faced by all
the three parties during the land registration and will also remove the intermediaries like property
dealers. This system makes the process of land registration resilient and decrease the cases of fraud
in the process. Using the system, validation of the lands is also possible as immutable transactions
are being stored in the public ledger.
For land, being a high-valued asset, it is very important to have accurate records which identify the
current owner and provide the proof that he is indeed a owner. These records can be used to:
a) protect ownerâ€™s rights
b) prevent sale frauds
c) resolve disputes
d) make sure ownership is correctly transferred to a new ownership
